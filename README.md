This repository contains a simple landing page for photographers who want to
display their work online. The focus is on ease of use and mobile-first design.
The frontend lives in the `public/` directory.

## Files

- `public/index.html` – landing page with an empty gallery and upload controls
- `public/styles.css` – responsive styles for the mobile-first layout
- `public/app.js` – logic to display uploaded images and a placeholder for
  Instagram integration
- `test.html` – original placeholder file

Feel free to expand on this foundation as you continue learning about frontend development.
